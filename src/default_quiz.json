    "question": "What is system requirement?",
    "answer": "A system requirement is a functional or non-functional need for a software system that the system must meet to satisfy its users, stakeholders, or regulatory bodies. Functional requirements specify the features, capabilities, or actions that the system must perform, while non-functional requirements specify the qualities or constraints that the system must have or satisfy, such as performance, reliability, usability, security, compatibility, or maintainability. System requirements are important because they help define the scope, goals, and success criteria of a software project, and they provide a basis for testing, validating, and verifying the system against its expected behavior and performance.",
